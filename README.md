#Crystal ball

This project is part of the Arduino Statrter Kit. 

Crystal ball can help "predict" the future. You ask a question to the all-knowing ball, and turn it over to reveal the answer. The answer will be predetermined, but you can write in anything you like. In this project is used Arduino to choose from total of 8 responses. The tilt switch in this kit will help replicate the motion of shaking the ball for answers.
